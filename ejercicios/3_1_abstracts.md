**Título:** "Adaptive Learning Systems Powered by AI: A Systematic Review of Implementation Outcomes in Higher Education"

**Abstract:**
*This systematic review examines the implementation and outcomes of AI-powered adaptive learning systems in higher education institutions between 2020-2024. We analyzed 45 peer-reviewed studies encompassing 12,847 students across 23 universities in North America and Europe. The methodology involved a comprehensive search of academic databases (ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science) followed by thematic analysis of implementation strategies and learning outcomes. Key findings indicate that AI-adaptive systems improve student engagement by an average of 34% and learning retention by 28% compared to traditional instructional methods. However, institutions reported significant challenges including high implementation costs (average $2.3M per institution), faculty resistance due to lack of training, and concerns about data privacy. The most successful implementations occurred in STEM fields, particularly computer science and mathematics, where content can be more easily structured algorithmically. The study reveals a critical gap between technological capabilities and pedagogical integration, suggesting that future research should focus on faculty development programs and ethical frameworks for AI implementation in educational settings.*

## Abstract 2

**Título:** "ChatGPT in the Classroom: Exploring Student Perceptions and Academic Integrity Implications"

**Abstract:**
*This mixed-methods study investigates undergraduate students' use of ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) for academic purposes and their perceptions of academic integrity. Through surveys (n=892) and focus groups (n=48) conducted across four universities in Australia, we examined usage patterns, perceived benefits, and ethical concerns. Quantitative analysis revealed that 73% of students had used ChatGPT for academic work, with the highest usage in literature reviews (45%), brainstorming ideas (67%), and improving writing quality (52%). Qualitative findings identified three main themes: (1) LLMs as "smart assistants" that enhance productivity and learning, (2) confusion about appropriate usage boundaries and citation practices, and (3) anxiety about academic penalties despite unclear institutional policies. Students expressed desire for clear guidelines rather than outright bans. The study found no significant correlation between GPA and ChatGPT usage frequency, challenging assumptions about its impact on academic performance. These findings suggest that universities need comprehensive policies that distinguish between appropriate assistance and academic misconduct, while providing training for both students and faculty on ethical AI integration in education.*

## Abstract 3

**Título:** "Machine Learning Algorithms for Early Prediction of Student Dropout: A Comparative Analysis of Ensemble Methods"

**Abstract:**
*Student dropout represents a significant challenge for higher education institutions, with global rates averaging 30-40%. This study compares the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in predicting first-year student dropout using pre-enrollment and early academic performance data. We analyzed records from 15,432 students across five universities over a three-year period (2021-2024), implementing and comparing six machine learning approaches: Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and a novel ensemble method combining multiple algorithms. Features included demographic data, high school performance, socioeconomic indicators, and first-semester grades. The ensemble method achieved the highest predictive accuracy (87.3%), followed by XGBoost (84.1%) and Random Forest (82.7%). Early intervention strategies based on these predictions resulted in a 23% reduction in dropout rates when implemented in the pilot group. Key predictive factors included first-semester GPA (importance score: 0.34), financial aid status (0.28), and frequency of academic support service usage (0.19). The study demonstrates that institutional data can effectively identify at-risk students within the first eight weeks of enrollment, enabling timely interventions. However, ethical considerations regarding student privacy and algorithmic bias require careful institutional oversight and transparent decision-making processes.*
